# Todo List (React/Redux) App

Simple todo app to test the stack React/Redux, based on [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot).

## Initial Machine Setup

1. **Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 
3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#working-with-editors-ides-supporting-safe-write)** to assure hot reloading works properly.
4. On a Mac? You're all set. If you're on Linux or Windows, complete the steps for your OS below.  

## Get Started

1. **Clone the project**. `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot.git`.
2. **Run the setup script**. `npm run setup`
3. **Run the example app**. `npm start -s`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
